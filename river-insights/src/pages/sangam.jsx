          When two rivers meet, it's called a confluence, and it's a fascinating natural event. 
          At this meeting point, the waters mix together, often creating a striking visual 
          effect, especially if the rivers are different colors due to varying sediments. It's a 
          place of natural beauty and ecological significance, illustrating the 
          interconnectedness of water systems and their collective journey towards larger 
          bodies of water.
